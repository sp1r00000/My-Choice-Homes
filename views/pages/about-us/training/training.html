      <h3>Objectives</h3>
      <p>The objectives of My Choice is to ensure young people are looked after, cared for and
        receive the services they need by competent staff who are trained to meet their needs. We
        give our staff the opportunity to receive training to broaden their skills and enable a
        better understanding of young people's needs and the purpose of the home and school.</p>
      <p>The first stage of training &amp; development is obtained by attending the Head Office
        Induction Day. This is an opportunity for new staff to gain an understanding of the
        recording systems, policies &amp; procedures required to fulfil the role of a Residential
        Support Worker. Child protection, medication and fire awareness is also discussed. The new
        staff member will then begin the Induction Programme which lasts 6 months. This induction
        has been developed from the CWDC (Children's Workforce Development Council) Standards. It
        incorporates key areas for development and knowledge within residential care.</p>
      <p>Staff work through the induction by attending training sessions, working with other
        colleagues and respective Line Managers. The induction programme cross-references into the
        Level 3 Diploma in Children &amp; Young People's Workforce qualification and Codes of
        Practice for social care workers from the GSCC (General Social Care Council).</p>

      <blockquote>

        and in the home I am based in, the team work so well together, have fun and do the best we
        can for the young people.
