  <h1>About My Choice Homes</h1>

  <section>
    <h2>Our Homes</h2>
    <p>Our homes provide a comfortable, non-institutional environment for young people to begin to work towards their
      future and independence, or return to home or to alternative carers. We are committed to and support the
      implementation of Care Plans for short, medium and long term placements.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Our Tools</h2>
    <p>We have developed many tools such as our own Placement Plans (in line with Standard 2 of the Minimum Standards
      for Children's Homes), which enables us to work closely with the young people to encourage and devise appropriate
      Care Plans identifying their current and future needs.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>National Care Standards</h2>
    <p>Since the implementation of the National Care Standards in April 2002, My Choice has established a very positive
      relationship with the Commission. We work in partnership with all our Placing Authorities believing open and
      constant communication between the Home, Young Person, Parents, Families and the Social Worker is essential to
      ensure effective and safe childcare.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Supportive Framework</h2>
    <p>Every young person brings with them unique life experiences and as such we treat all as individuals, being very
      clear about their specific needs.</p>
    <p>We look after the young person, not the perceived problem.</p>
    <p>Our service seeks to provide an effective and supportive framework for Young People who would otherwise be hard
      to place.</p>
  </section>

  <p>Every member of our team, whether RSW, Care Manager, Maintenance Worker, Office worker or Director, wants to be the
    best. We work hard to attract and retain truly talented people. People who share the same vision and approach, who
    help our young people to be the best that they can.</p>

  <p>We believe that our people underpin our strategic direction, provide a great energy, approachability and service
    excellence. Here at My Choice we embrace a culture where people can flourish and develop through hard work and
    commitment.</p>
