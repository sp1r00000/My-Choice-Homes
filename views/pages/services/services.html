    <h2>Residential Homes</h2>
    <p>Each home is located in a residential area. It is our policy to provide homes for young
      people within the community. We do not advertise their presence nor do we seek to
      stigmatise the young people through the use of institutionalised signs outside the homes.</p>

    <h2>Conventional Children's Homes</h2>
    <p>We do not provide waking nights staff as standard, as we believe this gives an unrealistic
      message to young people. Our model for the home is based nearer to fostering than to
      conventional children's homes.</p>

    <h2>Children's Home Alternative</h2>
