  <h2>Education and Support</h2>

  <p>My Choice is committed to increasing access to education and supporting and promoting active
    participation in education for all young people.</p>
  <p>Where any young person is unable to access a local school, for whatever reason, they may be
    registered at My Choice School. Students may spend their time with us as a transition programme
    while awaiting alternative school provision or may spend their time with us re-engaging with
    learning and preparing for their future.</p>
  <p>Teachers at My Choice School are experienced in working with challenging and complex behaviours
    and work with flexibility and enthusiasm while providing boundaries, structure and opportunity
    to succeed. RSWs provide support to the student in the classroom and on activities.</p>
